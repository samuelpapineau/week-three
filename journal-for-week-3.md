# Introduction 

## Resonances

Wow, what a week. Photogrammetry proved to be a little more challenging than I anticipated, but in the end it was still interesting to watch it all come together into something more or less 3D

*Yeah, not quite what I expected*

So with photogrammetry and web mapping, I had my fair share of successes and failures. I began with photogrammetry, and I quickly realized that some of the pictures I had taken were not easily recognized by Regard3D. This made it so only one side of the graves were visible. Unfortunately this was largely due to the location of the graves, since they were too close together to record individually, and a hedge on one side of the site prevented me from capturing pictures at a far enough distance so that the program might recognize them. It made me wonder why the graves were positioned so close together. Perhaps it was due to a strong familial bond, or maybe to allow for the most graves possible to fit on the family plot. Regardless, I feel like it would have been easier if several factors would have been improved, such as if the graves were out in an open area, or if the lighting would have been better (the area was partially covered by trees). Of course, I highly doubt the family had photogrammetry in mind when planning out the graves of their loved ones.

The next part of this project was web mapping. Luckily, I already have a fair bit of experience with html, but I have never done web mapping like this before. The recommended text editor was Sublime Text, but I opted to go with vscode since I already know how to use it relatively well. I successfully followed the examples and created a web map featuring the digital site map I created. I also added the map provided in the booklet I acquired (see Journal for Week 2), and was able to compare the two. The only problem I had during this part was the points for the graves, since when I put the coordinates into the GeoJSON converter, it showed them all over the place. At first I thought it was a problem on my end with the coordinated being mistyped, but I soon realized that it was probably the gps on my phone that wasn't properly calibrated. This meant that all the location data I collected was inaccurate. I suppose it shows that when going out in the field, to get accurate results, you need better equipment than a cell phone.

*If those points were correct, it would have been a fair bit of walking.*

I suppose, in a way, archaeology is like camping. No matter how meticulously you plan your trip, pack your gear, or prepare your schedule, nothing ever truly goes according to plan.




## Response to the Prompts

One text which I found rather significant was *The Burial Space Research Database* since it talks about the systematic collection of grave information into a database. It was mentioned that this was the inspiration for the data collection I did in Week 2, and it made me a little worried. Why was there a standardized process for recording unique graves? What kind of errors, inaccuracies, or misinterpreted information was there that was recorded into this database? What about information that was left out because there was no match? What is going to happen with the extra information that was added into the description boxes in the database? Will these features eventually be added into the forms, or will they forever remain as extra information? How will future archaeologists view this informattion if it isn't entirely accurate? What is the point of doing incomplete archaeology? These are questions I was asking myself when filling out the forms when I was recording the graves, and they were the same questions I was asking myself when reading the text. Sure, some were partially answered in the text, but I am not satisfied with the answers I got.

As described in *The Practice of Archaeology in a Globalized World* it is the archaeologist's responsibility to translate documented observations into a simpler form for the general public to understand. I personally believe that this should be done with 3D modelling instead of inserting likely inaccurate information into a database, since it allows for more accuracy, and a greater possibility for interpretation. While the technology for highly detailed photogrammetry exists, it is both time consuming and can be expensive.
