# what I was trying to do

This week I mainly attempted photogrammetry and web mapping. I was met with several successes and failures, and in the end while I was not able to complete them in the way I wanted. I feel like if I were to attempt it again, with the things I learned the first time, I would be able to get a result I'd happy with.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

As a self taught hobby web developer, seeing html in a digital archaeology class truly made my week. It's not every day that you get to combine both history and programming, and with what I've seen in the coming weeks, it seems I'll be able to do a little more of that.

## what I did

+ Started work on photogrammetry
	+ I had never used Regard3D before, though I was able to learn it relatively quickly thanks to the documents provided. Good documentation can be so hard to find!
+ Web mapping
	+ This was a new approach to maps in a web based environment I had not seen before. I was already familiar with html, python, and web servers, so working with this was rather simple to understand, but putting it all together accurately was a challenge.
+ Map Warper
	+ I had never used map warper before and it was rather difficult to use when zooming in on the maps and selecting points. While it is a very useful tool to have, I feel like it could be improved.

## challenges 

My biggest challenge is time. Learning new technologies requires patience and focus, and can be overwhelming sometimes when there is a lot to learn. The only remedy to this problem is time, and that can be difficult to manage when balanced with four other classes and a part time job. In this case for Week 3, I had many assignments due all at the same time and things piled up very quickly. Time management is something I need to work on.

## thoughts on where to go next

Even though my attempt at photogrammetry was not as successful as I had hoped, I would still like to try it out on objects in the future. Web mapping is also interesting and could be useful as well. My next step is to write up the consolidation document and to finish up this first part of the class, as I'm falling behind a bit and need to catch up.
